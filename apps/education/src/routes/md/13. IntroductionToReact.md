## Overview

TanStack Router is a modern, type-safe router for React applications. It provides a declarative way to define routes and navigate between different components in your application. The router manages the rendering of components based on the current URL, allowing for a seamless user experience in single-page applications.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Examples

#### Example 1: Setting up the Router

**File: /src/main.tsx**

```typescript
import { RouterProvider, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen.js";

const router = createRouter({ routeTree, defaultPreload: "intent" });

// Render the app
const rootElement = document.querySelector("#app");
if (rootElement) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);
  root.render(
    <StrictMode>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </StrictMode>
  );
}
```

**Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to set up TanStack Router in a React application. We create a router instance using `createRouter` and provide it with a route tree. The `RouterProvider` component is then used to make the router available throughout the application.

#### Example 2: Defining Routes

**File: /src/routes/index.tsx**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: () => <div>Home Page</div>,
});
```

**Explanation**: This example shows how to define a simple route using TanStack Router. The `createFileRoute` function is used to create a route for the home page ("/").

### Intermediate Examples

#### Example 3: Nested Routes

**File: /src/routes/users/index.tsx**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/")({
  component: () => (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  ),
});
```

**File: /src/routes/users/$userId.tsx**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/$userId")({
  component: ({ params }) => <div>User ID: {params.userId}</div>,
});
```

**Explanation**: This example demonstrates nested routing. We have a parent route for "/users/" and a child route for individual users ("/users/$userId"). The `Outlet` component in the parent route is where child routes will be rendered.

**Key Points**:

- Nested routes allow for more complex application structures.
- The `$` prefix in the filename indicates a dynamic segment in the route.

### Advanced Examples

#### Example 4: Using Loaders and Actions

**File: /src/routes/posts.tsx**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/posts")({
  loader: async () => {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/posts");
    return res.json();
  },
  component: ({ useLoader }) => {
    const posts = useLoader();
    return (
      <div>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  },
});
```

**Explanation**: This advanced example shows how to use loaders in TanStack Router. The loader function fetches data before the component renders, and the component can then access this data using the `useLoader` hook.

**Key Concepts**:

- Loaders: Functions that load data for a route before rendering.
- Actions: Functions that handle form submissions or other data mutations.

**Considerations**:

- Loaders run on both server and client, so they should be isomorphic.
- Error handling should be implemented for both loaders and actions.

#### Example 5: Route Guards

**File: /src/routes/admin.tsx**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute, redirect } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/admin")({
  beforeLoad: async () => {
    const isAuthenticated = await checkAuthStatus();
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
      throw redirect({ to: "/login" });
    }
  },
  component: () => <div>Admin Dashboard</div>,
});
```

**Explanation**: This example demonstrates how to implement route guards using the `beforeLoad` hook. It checks if the user is authenticated before allowing access to the admin route.

**Why This is Advanced**:

- It involves handling asynchronous operations before route rendering.
- It uses redirection for access control.

**Potential Pitfalls**:

- Overusing route guards can lead to performance issues.
- Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures.

### Real-World Scenario

#### Example 6: E-commerce Product Page with Reviews

**File: /src/routes/products/$productId.tsx**

```typescript
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { ProductDetails, ReviewList, AddReviewForm } from "../components";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/products/$productId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    const [productRes, reviewsRes] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(`https://api.example.com/products/${params.productId}`),
      fetch(`https://api.example.com/products/${params.productId}/reviews`)
    ]);
    return {
      product: await productRes.json(),
      reviews: await reviewsRes.json()
    };
  },
  action: async ({ params, formData }) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/products/${params.productId}/reviews`, {
      method: "POST",
      body: formData
    });
    return response.json();
  },
  component: ({ useLoader, useAction }) => {
    const { product, reviews } = useLoader();
    const addReview = useAction();

    return (
      <div>
        <ProductDetails product={product} />
        <ReviewList reviews={reviews} />
        <AddReviewForm onSubmit={addReview} />
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

**Context**: This scenario represents a product page in an e-commerce application, displaying product details and reviews, with the ability to add new reviews.

**Implementation Details**:

1. The loader fetches both product details and reviews concurrently.
2. An action is defined to handle new review submissions.
3. The component renders product details, review list, and a form for adding new reviews.

**Benefits**:

- Efficient data loading with concurrent requests.
- Separation of data fetching (loader) and UI rendering (component).
- Built-in form handling with actions.

**Challenges**:

- Managing loading and error states for multiple API calls.
- Ensuring responsive UI during data fetching and form submission.

**Further Optimization**: Implement optimistic UI updates for review submissions to improve perceived performance.

## Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is the purpose of the `RouterProvider` component?

**Answer**: The `RouterProvider` component makes the router instance available throughout the React application.

**Explanation**:
The `RouterProvider` is a crucial component in TanStack Router that wraps your entire application. It serves several key purposes:

- It provides the router context to all child components, allowing them to access routing information and functions.
- It manages the overall routing state of the application.
- It handles the initial routing on application load and subsequent route changes.

By wrapping your application with `RouterProvider`, you ensure that all components have access to the routing functionality, enabling features like navigation, access to route parameters, and more.

**Example**:

```jsx
import { RouterProvider, createRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { routeTree } from "./routeTree.gen";

const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

function App() {
  return (
    <RouterProvider router={router}>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </RouterProvider>
  );
}
```

### Q2: How do you create a dynamic route in TanStack Router?

**Answer**: Dynamic routes in TanStack Router are created by using file names with parameters prefixed with `$`.

**Step-by-step solution**:

1. Create a new file in your routes directory with the dynamic part prefixed with `$`.
2. Use `createFileRoute` to define the route.
3. Access the dynamic parameter in your component using the `params` prop.

**Code Implementation**:

```typescript
// File: /src/routes/users/$userId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/$userId")({
  component: ({ params }) => <div>User ID: {params.userId}</div>,
});
```

**Considerations**:

- Ensure that your route tree generator is configured to pick up these dynamic routes.
- Be prepared to handle cases where the dynamic parameter might not exist or be invalid.

### Q3: What is the difference between `loader` and `action` in TanStack Router?

**Answer**: Loaders are used for data fetching before rendering, while actions are used for handling form submissions or data mutations.

**Detailed Explanation**:
Loaders and actions are both powerful features in TanStack Router, but they serve different purposes:

**Loaders**:

- Run before the component renders.
- Used for fetching data that the component needs.
- Can return any serializable data.
- Are automatically revalidated when route parameters change.

**Actions**:

- Typically triggered by user interactions (e.g., form submissions).
- Used for creating, updating, or deleting data.
- Can return data or throw redirects.
- Often used in conjunction with forms.

**Loader Example**:

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users")({
  loader: async () => {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/users");
    return res.json();
  },
  component: ({ useLoader }) => {
    const users = useLoader();
    return <UserList users={users} />;
  },
});
```

**Action Example**:

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/new")({
  action: async ({ formData }) => {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/users", {
      method: "POST",
      body: formData,
    });
    return res.json();
  },
  component: ({ useAction }) => {
    const createUser = useAction();
    return <UserForm onSubmit={createUser} />;
  },
});
```

### Q4: How does TanStack Router handle code splitting and lazy loading?

**Answer**: TanStack Router supports code splitting and lazy loading through dynamic imports and React's `lazy` function.

**Detailed Explanation**:
Code splitting and lazy loading are crucial for optimizing the performance of large React applications. TanStack Router integrates seamlessly with React's lazy loading capabilities:

- You can use dynamic `import()` statements to load route components on demand.
- Combine this with React's `lazy` function to create components that are loaded only when needed.
- TanStack Router will automatically handle the loading states and errors associated with lazy-loaded components.

This approach allows you to split your application into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary code for each route, which can significantly improve initial load times and overall performance.

**Advanced Example**:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const LazyAdminDashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./AdminDashboard"));

export const Route = createFileRoute("/admin")({
  component: () => (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyAdminDashboard />
    </React.Suspense>
  ),
});
```

**Best Practices**:

- Use lazy loading for large or infrequently accessed parts of your application.
- Implement proper loading indicators to improve user experience during lazy loading.
- Consider preloading important routes to improve perceived performance.

### Q5: How would you implement a 404 Not Found page in a TanStack Router application?

**Scenario**: You want to display a custom 404 page when a user navigates to a non-existent route in your application.

**Solution Approach**:

1. Create a catch-all route that matches any unhandled path.
2. Implement a Not Found component to render for this route.
3. Use the `createFileRoute` function to define this catch-all route.

**Key Considerations**:

- The catch-all route should be the last route in your route hierarchy.
- Ensure that the Not Found page provides useful information and navigation options.

**Code Implementation**:

```typescript
// File: /src/routes/$404.tsx
import { createFileRoute, Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/$404")({
  component: () => (
    <div>
      <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
      <p>Sorry, the page you are looking for does not exist.</p>
      <Link to="/">Go back to home</Link>
    </div>
  ),
});
```

**Explanation**:
This implementation creates a catch-all route that will match any path not handled by other routes. The `$404` filename is a convention used by TanStack Router to indicate a catch-all route. The component renders a simple 404 page with a link back to the home page.

## Conceptual Questions

1. Which of the following is NOT a feature of TanStack Router?
   A) Type-safe routing
   B) Server-side rendering support
   C) Built-in state management
   D) Loader and action functions

   **Answer**: C) Built-in state management
   **Explanation**: While TanStack Router offers many features like type-safe routing, SSR support, and loader/action functions, it does not provide built-in state management. For state management, you would typically use other libraries like Redux or React Context.

2. TanStack Router uses file-based routing.

   **Answer**: True
   **Explanation**: TanStack Router indeed uses a file-based routing system. Route files are typically placed in a `routes` directory, and the file structure determines the route structure. This approach makes it easy to organize and understand the routing of an application at a glance.

3. How does TanStack Router differ from traditional React routers like React Router?

   **Sample Answer**: TanStack Router differs from traditional React routers in several key ways:
   1. It provides full type safety, leveraging TypeScript to catch routing errors at compile-time.
   2. It uses a file-based routing system, similar to Next.js, which can simplify route organization.
   3. It offers built-in data fetching and mutation capabilities through loaders and actions.
   4. It has better performance optimization, including automatic code splitting and prefetching.
   5. It provides a more declarative API for defining routes and their behaviors.

   **Key Points**:
   - Type safety
   - File-based routing
   - Built-in data handling
   - Performance optimizations
   - Declarative API

Certainly! I'll continue from the Conceptual Questions section:

4. Analyze the following code snippet:

```typescript
export const Route = createFileRoute("/users/$userId/posts/$postId")({
  loader: async ({ params }) => {
    const { userId, postId } = params;
    const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}/posts/${postId}`);
    return res.json();
  },
  component: ({ useLoader }) => {
    const post = useLoader();
    return <PostDetails post={post} />;
  },
});
```

   **Question**: What does this code do, and what are its key features?
   **Answer**: This code defines a route for displaying a specific post by a specific user. Key features include:

- It uses a dynamic route with two parameters: `userId` and `postId`.
- It implements a loader function to fetch data before rendering the component.
- The loader uses the route parameters to make an API call.
- The component uses the `useLoader` hook to access the fetched data.
- It renders a `PostDetails` component with the fetched post data.

5. In the context of TanStack Router, what is the purpose of the `Outlet` component?

   **Scenario**: You're building a nested route structure for an e-commerce application.

   **Question**: How and why would you use the `Outlet` component in this scenario?

   **Answer**: The `Outlet` component in TanStack Router is used to render child routes within a parent route. In an e-commerce application, you might use it like this:

   1. Create a parent route for the product category page.
   2. Use the `Outlet` component in this parent route to render child routes.
   3. Create child routes for individual product pages.

   **Example**:

   ```jsx
   // Parent route: /products
   export const Route = createFileRoute("/products")({
     component: () => (
       <div>
         <h1>Products</h1>
         <nav>{/* Category navigation */}</nav>
         <Outlet /> {/* This is where child routes will render */}
       </div>
     ),
   });

   // Child route: /products/$productId
   export const ProductRoute = createFileRoute("/products/$productId")({
     component: () => <ProductDetails />
   });
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `Outlet` component allows for a flexible and modular route structure. It enables you to create a consistent layout for the product pages while dynamically rendering different content for each product. This approach promotes code reuse and maintains a clear hierarchy in your routing structure.
